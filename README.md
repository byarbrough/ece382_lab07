[Lab 7 - A/D Conversion - "Robot Sensing"](http://ece382.com/labs/lab7/index.html)

##Prelab

The first thing that I am going to do for my prelab is remove the IR sensor that I used for the last lab. I will then use the DMM to verify that all of the sensors are working correctly. Following this I will be ready to begin wiring and coding and all kinds of fun stuff.

###Code
Most of the neaccesary code is already provided [here](http://ecse.bd.psu.edu/cmpen352/lecture/code/lec36.c), so I will mostly just use that. I plan on making very nice methods so that I can incorporate it into a library. Doing that should grant an easier time during Lab 8.
