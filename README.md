[Lab 7 - A/D Conversion - "Robot Sensing"](http://ece382.com/labs/lab7/index.html)

##Prelab

The first thing that I am going to do for my prelab is remove the IR sensor that I used for the last lab. I will then use the DMM to verify that all of the sensors are working correctly. Following this I will be ready to begin wiring and coding and all kinds of fun stuff.
